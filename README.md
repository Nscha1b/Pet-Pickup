Project Goal
--------
This project was built to practice fundamental programming concepts. I saw a project that was used in the real world, and I wanted to find out if I had the skills to produce a similar result.

This project grew exponentially over time. Originally I just wanted to make an angular based front end application. After accomplishing that, I still had questions on how a full stack application worked. I kept adding code until I answered those questions.
